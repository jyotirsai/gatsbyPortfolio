excerpt: A brief overview of a basic chat application I made with React, Express, socket.io, and Auth0.

Making a web application with socket.io was something I had on my to-do list for a while but being
relatively new to web development, I was quite intimidated. After implementing sockets.io in a basic
chat application, I was pleasantly surprised at how simple it was!

I started learning React a couple
months ago and immediately loved using it, so I chose React to build the front end / client side
of the app. For the backend, I went with Express. I also chose Auth0 to implement authentication.

The project has two main folders: client and server. React will reside in client and
Express will be in server.

```git
npx create-react-app .
```

```git
npm install Express
```

Socket.io is used to communicate between the client and server. In order to do this, we'll need to have
the socket.io-client package installed in client/ and the socket.io package in server/.

```git
npm install socket.io-client
```

```git
npm install socket.io
```

Before implementing socket.io, let's build the chat functionality. There are two main components: a container
where the messages are displayed and a form that is composed of an input field for the user to type a message, and
a button the user can click on to submit the message.

```jsx
// client/src/components/Chat.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { Paper, Typography, Grid } from "@material-ui/core"
import Messages from "./Messages/Messages";
import FormBox from "./FormBox/FormBox";

const Chat = () => {
  const [messageItem, setMessageItem] = useState({
    name: "",
    message: "",
  });
  const [messageArray, setMessageArray] = useState([]);


  useEffect(() => {
    setMessageArray((messageArray) => [...messageArray, messageItem]);
  }, []);

  const submitClick = (e) => {
      ...
  };

  return (
    <Paper square variant="outlined">
      <Grid container justify="space-between" direction="column">
        <Grid item >
          <Typography variant="h5" align="center">
            Chat
          </Typography>
        </Grid>
        <Grid
          container
          item
          alignItems="flex-end"
        >
          <Messages messageArray={messageArray} />
        </Grid>
        <Grid item container justify="space-between">
          <FormBox
            submitClick={submitClick}
            setMessageItem={setMessageItem}
            messageItem={messageItem}
          />
        </Grid>
      </Grid>
    </Paper>
  );
};

export default Chat;
```

I'll go over the above code block from the top. We are using the useState hook to set the state of our message item.
The value of the input field where the user enters the message is set to the messageItem variable, which is an object with
two fields: name and message. I'll talk more about the name field when we go over authentication. Initially, messageItem is blank
and when the user types, we retrieve what they're typing with setMessageItem.
