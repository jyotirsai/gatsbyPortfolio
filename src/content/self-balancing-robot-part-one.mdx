Part one of this blog series will go over what a self-balancing robot is and the theory behind how it works.
Self-balancing robots are usually two-wheeled robots that balance by counteracting any forward or backwards tipping.
They behave similar to an inverted pendulum as seen below:

From wikipedia, an [inverted pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pendulum) is "a pendulum that has its center of mass above its pivot point".
In the case of a self-balancing robot, the pivot point is a line that passes through the centers of both wheels perpendicularly, like an axle. The rest of the
components that make up the robot (battery, sensors, etc) are housed above the wheels causing the center of mass to shift slightly above the wheels.

In the case of an actual pendulum, gravity ensures the balance of the system. When a pendulum swings out to the left or right, gravity brings it back to the center to achieve
equilibrium. With our self-balancing robot, the motors take on the role of gravity. As a pendulum swings out to the right, the tangential component
of gravity acts opposite to the trajectory of the pendulum to slow it down to zero velocity and then accelerate it back to the center. Our motors however, will control the system
by speeding up in the direction that the robot is tipping i.e. if the robot is falling forwards, the motors will accelerate in the forward direction until the robot is vertical again.
Why does moving in the same direction that the robot is falling end up balancing the robot? The robot chassis falls due to gravity, which provides an angular acceleration on the chassis
and pulls it down. When we move in the same direction the robot is falling, the bottom part of the chassis (at the pivot point) is closing the horizontal distance between it and the chassis'
center of mass. Once the horizontal distance between them is 0, the robot has been balanced and the chassis is vertical again. The rate at which we close this horizontal distance
must be greater than the rate at which the robot is falling in order to balance it once again. The greater the angle of tilt from equilibrium, the faster we need to move since we have less
time to 'catch' the falling chassis.
