Welcome to my blog! I made this website using Gatsby.js, GraphQL, and Material UI. Gatsby is a React framework mainly used to make fast static sites. It is commonly used to make blogs
and has a variety of plugins to easily add common features to your site. One of the features in my website is MDX, which allows React components to be embedded within markdown. GraphQL
is used to fetch posts with the .mdx file extension where they are then populated on the home page. Features to be added in the future include:

<ul>
  <li>SEO components</li>
  <li>Custom 404 page</li>
  <li>Google Analytics</li>
  <li>RSS Feed</li>
  <li>Search</li>
</ul>
